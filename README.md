# Knapsack Problem Solved - Hill Climbing Algorithm

In this notebook the a search algorithm is applied for solving the knapsack problem, wherein one must decide which items to be packed based on a given list containing each item's weight and values. For solving this issue the hill climbing optizimization algorithm was applied using the mlrose library.
