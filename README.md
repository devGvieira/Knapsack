# Knapsack

In the notebooks presented here two different search algorithms were applied for solving the problem of choosing items to pack based on their weights and values, the knapsack problem. For accomplishing such objective, the optimization algorithms hill climbing and simulated annealing were implemented through the mlrose library and compared based on their fitness.
